### Components

- **Frontend (Flutter)**
  - *Student App*: Track buses, view schedules, get live updates.
  - *Driver App*: Send real-time GPS data from the bus.
  - *Admin Dashboard*: Web-based management for routes, buses, and analytics.
- **Backend (Firebase)**
  - Real-time Database for live location and schedule sync.
  - Authentication for secure, role-based access.
  - Cloud Functions for automation and notifications.
- **Location & Mapping**
  - Google Maps API for route visualization and geolocation.
  - Geolocator for accurate GPS tracking.

### Data Flow

1. **Student logs in** and requests bus location.
2. **Driver’s app** sends live GPS data to Firebase.
3. **Backend** updates location in real-time.
4. **Google Maps API** displays current position and route.
5. **Admin dashboard** provides operational insights and management tools.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Frontend (Flutter)

- **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod for smooth state flow.
- **Google Maps SDK**: For real-time tracking and visualization.
- **Material Design**: Responsive, modern UI.
- **Location Services**: Geolocator package for precise GPS.

### Backend (Firebase)

- **Realtime Database**: Live updates for location and schedules.
- **Authentication**: Secure login for all user types.
- **Cloud Functions**: For automation (e.g., geofencing notifications).
- **Cloud Firestore**: Stores metadata like feedback and reports.

### APIs & Integrations

- **Google Maps API**: Real-time mapping and route optimization.
- **Geolocation API**: For accurate bus coordinates.
- **WebSockets**: Instant updates across devices.
- **GeoFencing**: Alerts when the bus reaches a stop.

## 🚦 How to Run

> **Note:** Replace the test Google Maps API key with your own for full functionality.

### 👑 Admin Dashboard

flutter run -t lib/main_admin.dart


### 🧑‍✈️ Driver App

flutter run -t lib/main_driver.dart


### 🎓 Student App

flutter run -t lib/main_student.dart

## ⚠️ Limitations & Cautions

> **🚧 Using a test API key!**  
> - Routes between stops appear as straight lines, not actual roads.  
> - Path validation and mobile deployment are restricted until you add a licensed Google Maps API key.
> - Currently, the system is only available via web/localhost.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Licensed Google Maps API**: Unlocks real-world routing and traffic info.
- **Full Mobile App Support**: Native Android/iOS deployment.
- **AI Route Optimization**: Smarter, faster, and more efficient bus routes.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts for delays and changes.
- **Offline Mode**: Last known location and schedule even without internet.
- **Feedback & Analytics**: In-app feedback and performance analytics.
- **QR Code Boarding**: Secure bus access and attendance tracking.

---

## 🏆 Why Use This System?

- **No more guesswork:** Know exactly when your bus arrives!
- **Smarter campus:** Admins can optimize routes and schedules.
- **Safer journeys:** Real-time monitoring ensures safety and transparency.
- **Modern & scalable:** Built with the latest tech for future-ready campuses.
